  A massive processing array for vision applicaiton based on TTA cores

TTA processors were arranged on a grid. A FU is added to TTAs to communicate with neighbouring TTAs. SystemC model of array is based on SystemC model of TTA array and TCE SystemC library. A few main operations of image processing including convolution, pooling and LBP were simulated on the array
